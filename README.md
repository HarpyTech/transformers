This repository demonstrates the use of Pipeline and Transformers in machine learning to automate and standardize data preprocessing. By utilizing Pipeline, we can chain multiple data transformation steps, ensuring a consistent and efficient workflow. ColumnTransformer allows us to apply different transformations to numerical and categorical data, while custom transformers enable us to handle specific preprocessing tasks tailored to our dataset.

Key features:

Automated Data Preprocessing: Streamline the preprocessing steps with Pipeline, reducing manual intervention and potential errors.

ColumnTransformer: Apply separate transformations to numerical and categorical data, enhancing model performance.

Custom Transformers: Create and integrate custom transformers for specific preprocessing needs, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and examples to help you implement these techniques in your machine learning projects, improving model performance and interpretability.
